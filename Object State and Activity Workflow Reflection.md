# Reflection

This assignment was quite intense for me but i have learnt a lot. I didn't understand what state diagrams were and what they we used for, until this assignment. Creating them was a challenge because i had to select critical objects for the system, which was also not easy but i believe, eventually, i got things right.
Another challenge was creatig the activity flow diagrams for some of the system functionalities or processes. This was not as bad because i decided that i will use the same objects i had used for the state diagrams. 

What became a challenge was ensuring that the objects i had selected to use would meet some of the requirements stated in Assignment 4, while also considering th user stories i i had created from the issues, in Assignment 6. Overall, the assignment was not too bad, but rather a bit complex. Nevertheless, there is so much i keep learning, particularly regarding the markdown format of writing and its code.
