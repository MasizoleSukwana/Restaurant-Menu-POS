# Reflection on Use Case Modeling and Test Case Development for the System

In this phase of the project, where things are starting to get clearer and the direction of the project, it was not an easy task to assess the Requirements, both Funtional and Non-Functional.

Funtional Requirements are usually easy to understand as they speak to the basic functionality of the system, however, you always need to understand the relationship between the requirements and the value they add to the system.
Whilst doing so, one cannot ignore the Non-Functional Requirements of the system, which focus on the performance, usability, securiy, optimization, maintenance, etc. of the system. They need to be practical and align with what the overall system requirements are.

**Use Case Diagram Modeling:** This was not an easy task, the first challenge was getting the appropriate code that would generate the Use Case Diagram using mermaid .js formart, which i have never used before.
This led to ongoing stuggle as i tried generating the code and the diagram using different AI Tools to assist, but ultimately, that was not successful. The alternative however, was to use UML drawing applications such as Lucidchart to draw up my use case diagram.
I was finally succesful in designing a use case system with one of the UML drawing applications available online, via: https://online.visual-paradigm.com/

**Test Case Development:** Creating test cases from the requirements was not so difficult, even though, there was concern of coming with meaningful test cases that would cover the basic funtionality of the system.
I considered the non-functional requrements depply, because they are often not easily testable, and thus, it is never easy to come up with test cases for them. 
Because the non-functional requirements were defined, i eventually managed to come up with a few.

Overall, i this task was not quite challenging as the previous tasks, i think it is because there is reasonable progress going on, and there is knowledge and understanding of the proposed system functionality, as a result, it is becoming a lot easier to align everything together into a flow. I have also finally managed to understand how this markdown code/file creation works, so i am a bit comfortable working with it now, which i find intresting because initially, i was very confused and didn't realise how possible it was to deliver the previous submissions using this markdown format.
