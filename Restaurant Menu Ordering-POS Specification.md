# System Specification Document

# Introduction
This is an overview of the proposed system and the project's main purpose and goals.
# Project Title - Restaurant POS for Ordering MENU
# Domain - Restaurant
The term "restaurant" describes the general idea, offerings, and procedures involved in managing a food service enterprise that serves meals and drinks to patrons. 
This domain includes elements that specify the structure of the restaurant, such as but not restricted to:
  **Menu management** is the process of developing, revising, and providing a range of food and drink selections for patrons.
  **Order management** is the process of managing consumer orders, whether they are placed over the phone, online, or in person.
  **Customer service:** Making sure that patrons have a satisfying dining experience by interacting with managers, cooks, and servers.
  **Staff Management** is about managing the personnel, which includes waiters, chefs, kitchen workers, and cleaners.
  **Inventory management** is keeping track of the materials, drinks, and ingredients required to operate the restaurant.
  **Reservations and Seating**: Handling walk-ins, reservations, and seating configurations for visitors.
  **Processing consumer payments**, such as those made with cash, credit/debit cards, or digital wallets, is known as payment processing.
  **Health and Safety Rules**: Complying with regional laws and food safety guidelines to protect patrons.
# Problem Statement
Customers often experience delays in being seated and receiving menus at restaurants, especially when there are no reservations and the establishment is short-staffed. 
This leads to a lengthy process as customers must wait for waiters/waitresses to allocate tables and assist with menu orders, resulting in a less efficient and frustrating dining experience.
# Proposed Solution/Feasibility Scope
Implementing a Menu Ordering System that enables customers to browse the menu, customize orders, and pay digitally. 
Integrated with a POS system for seamless payment processing and a kitchen display system for faster order preparation. 
This solution reduces reliance on the staff, minimizes order errors, and streamlines the entire dining experience.
