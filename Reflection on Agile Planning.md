# Reflection on Agile Planning for the System

I want to highlight that this assignment might have been the most challenging one so far. From understanding the tasks themselves to actually doing them was very intense.
After having gone through the assignment document, i was confused as to how i could possibly deliver the deliverables, and i was not sure if my approach would be correct, to me the criteria for submission.

**User Story Creation:** This task was not as intense as i had imagined, however, i had to get some guidance from the AI tools on the approach since i have never created any user stories, using Github.
After having found some guidance, i had to go back to Assignment 3 and 4 to decide on which Requirements and use Cases to use for creating user stories. Considering that all requirements are important for the implementation of the system, making the selcting was not easy.
However, because the task is to select requirements from the Functional Requirements only, that kind of reduced the pressure and frustratio i had, then i selected the most critical requirements, in my opinion.

**Product Backlog Creation:** Creating the product backlog was fairly easy because my user stories were already created, it was only a matter of prioritizing them according to their importnace, dependency and the overall impact they have on the functionality of the system.
The MoSCow prioratization format was new to me, i had never heard about it before, so my approach was to try and undertand its definition and meaning before applying it to my project.
I tried fulfilling this task by relying on the Milestones. I had to create milestones for the project items, which would categorize them based on their importance in the product backlog.

**Sprint Planning:** Planning the sprint was not as difficult but i did not how to go about it using Github, but thanks to the AI tools for some guidance. Eventually, i knew, that all the tasks that i had marked as High priority and critical for the project, would be the first one to be added to the Sprint.
I relied on the milestones i had created to make my selection because then, i knew that all the important tasks and the Must-Have tasks were priority for the first sprint.

## Summary
Overall, due to the requirements of the Assignment itself, i was not sure if what had been done above was sufficient, consequently, i created Tables for each tasks required using the markdown file/format to ensure that the deliverables we complete.
I also found the Agile Planning Documentation useful as it compiled every artefact i had initially created independently, in a single document. this makes it easy for anyone who needs the overall assignment in a single view, instead of going through every markdown file or project tasks' URL.
