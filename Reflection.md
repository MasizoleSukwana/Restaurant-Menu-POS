# Reflection on Stakeholder Requirements Balancing

As this is an ideal project and system, having to come up with requirements for all the stakeholders has been a challenge as i tried to imagine a real world situation.
The truth is, some requirements are feasible and some may not be, but the whole idea is to ensure that the system requirements are met.
Each stakeholders' requirement is treated with the same priority as the rest.
The challenge is not knowing whether all of them can be attainable.
Alighning the requirements with the project and system has also been challenging, because at the time of the submission of Assignment 3, there was no clue that theew would be a follow up assignment.
As a result, trying to figure out requirements and idenitifying the stakeholders was a bit challenging.
