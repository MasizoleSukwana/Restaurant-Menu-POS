# Reflection

Technically, creatively, and personally, working on the Masi Restaurant POS system has been a life-changing educational experience. I was forced to step outside of my comfort zone during this project, particularly in the areas of system design thinking, peer review, and cooperation. This project required constant interaction with people, which was both satisfying and eye-opening in contrast to earlier tasks where I could primarily work alone.

Learning how to effectively convey my technical difficulties and concepts to others has been one of the most beneficial lessons I've learned. Opening up and sharing my idea was initially challenging for me because I often work alone and this system felt very personal, something I had put a lot of time and energy into. However, because the process required peer review and collaboration, I had to actively seek out additional people to include, whether it was for code reviews, system design criticism, or enhancement suggestions. I was shocked by how beneficial and useful those exchanges turned out to be. I started to value the perspectives that others shared, many of which resulted in noticeable advancements in fields like abstraction layers, modularization, and test design.

I gained a deeper grasp of clean architecture and domain-driven development from a technical standpoint as a result of developing the service architecture, including the OrderService, MenuService, PaymentService, and repo layers. It was initially difficult to integrate the domain model with repository patterns and use factories to manage various storage kinds. But after some direction and iteration, I started to appreciate how these design principles enhance flexibility and scalability; two important aspects of real-world systems.

Given the challenges I faced in the previous milestones, I was a little taken aback by the vote and peer rating outcomes. Looking back, though, I can see that I have improved not just in my technical abilities but also in my capacity to share, lead, and ask for assistance when needed.

All in all, I'm quite amazed at how much I've discovered and how advanced the system has become. Beyond merely teaching me code, the POS project has given me real-world experience in teamwork, creating impactful software, and creating something that can truly make a difference. I'm thrilled about the future and eager to continue making contributions to this system and others of a similar nature.
