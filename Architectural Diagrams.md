# Restaurant Menu Ordering-POS Diagrams

# Project Title - Restaurant POS for Ordering MENU
# Domain - Restaurant
# Problem Statement
Customers often experience delays in being seated and receiving menus at restaurants, especially when there are no reservations and the establishment is short-staffed. 
This leads to a lengthy process as customers must wait for waiters/waitresses to allocate tables and assist with menu orders, resulting in a less efficient and frustrating dining experience.
# Proposed Solution/Feasibility Scope
Implementing a Menu Ordering System that enables customers to browse the menu, customize orders, and pay digitally. 
Integrated with a POS system for seamless payment processing and a kitchen display system for faster order preparation. 
This solution reduces reliance on the staff, minimizes order errors, and streamlines the entire dining experience.
