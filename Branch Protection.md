## Protection Rules - Justification
Orders from customers, payments, and inventory management are all handled by the Masi Restaurant POS System. It is essential to enforce branch protection rules in order to preserve **code integrity, security, and uptime**.

The GitHub branch protection rules that are enabled are listed below, along with an explanation of their significance:

---

## Explanation of Each Rule

### 1. **Require a pull request before merging**
- **What it does**: stops commits to the `main` branch from happening directly.
- **Why it matters**: Reviewing changes lowers the possibility that untested or unstable features will make it into production.

---

### 2. **Require approvals**
- **What it does**: Requires the pull request to be approved by at least one team member.
- **Why it matters**: Guarantees that the modification is validated by several developers, identifying mistakes early.

---

### 3. **Require review from Code Owners**
- **What it does**: Needs expertise in a certain subject (stock, payment, orders, etc.) to examine modifications.
- **Why it matters**: Protects important modules like `OrderService` and `PaymentService` from being incorrectly modified.

---

### 4. **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- **What it does**: Guarantees the success of automated tests, linting, or build processes.
- **Why it matters**: Keeps errors and malfunctioning code from being added to the live system.

---

### 5. **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- **What it does**: Before merging, the branch is forced to synchronize with `main`.
- **Why it matters**: Avoids combining out-of-date code that can cause incompatibilities.

---

### 6. **Require signed commits**
- **What it does**: Verifies the legitimacy and trustworthiness of the commit authors.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures that only confirmed contributors push updates, increasing security.

---

### 7. **Require deployments to succeed before merging**
- **What it does**: In the event that the staging/production deployment fails, blocks will merge.
- **Why it matters**: Guarantees the code not only passes tests but can also be deployed cleanly.
