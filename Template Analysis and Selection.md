# Template Analysis and Selection - Overview
This section is about comparing the GitHub's Project templates and selecting the best one that is suitable for the Restaurant-POS Ordering Menu System.
This will help in facilitating any project related work, going forward. 
- The end goal is to find the template that will align with the system requirements.
- The selection will be achieved by considering the user stories identified in Assignment 6, based on their MoSCow prioratization in the backlog.

## Analysis
The analysis is based on what each template is capable of achieving.

| **Template Name**         | **Best For**                                   | **Key Features**                                          | **Columns & Workflows**                         | **Automation Features**                           | **Agile Suitability**             | **Ideal Users**                   | **Limitations**                                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Roadmap**               | Long-term strategic planning & vision tracking | Organizes work by milestones/releases, visualizes priorities, aligns teams across projects | Customizable columns (e.g., "Planning," "In Progress," "Completed") | Auto-updates statuses based on linked issues and pull requests | Partially Agile – good for high-level planning but not for daily sprints | Product managers, leadership teams | Not suited for day-to-day sprint tracking, can become too high-level |
| **Iterative Development** | Agile workflows (Scrum, Kanban)                | Supports sprints, backlog prioritization, WIP limits, integrates with GitHub Issues | Predefined Agile columns ("Backlog," "To Do," "In Progress," "Done") | Auto-assign issues, auto-move tasks when status changes | Highly Agile – best for iterative and incremental development | Agile teams, software developers | Requires frequent updates, may not suit teams following traditional waterfall models |
| **Product Launch**        | Coordinating product release activities        | Tracks pre-launch, launch, and post-launch tasks, assigns ownership, sets deadlines | Customizable launch phases (e.g., "Planning," "Executing," "Post-Launch") | Sends reminders for deadlines, auto-closes completed tasks | Not Agile-focused – more suited for event-based workflows | Marketing teams, product managers | Becomes obsolete after launch, requires transition to another template |
| **Bug Tracker**           | Tracking and resolving software bugs           | Categorizes by severity, integrates with GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, labels for prioritization | Predefined bug-fixing workflow ("New," "In Progress," "Needs Review," "Resolved") | Auto-labels based on severity, auto-assigns issues | Some Agile support – useful for issue tracking in Agile sprints | QA teams, developers, support engineers | Not ideal for tracking features or improvements, can become cluttered without proper triage |
| **Feature Release**       | Managing development and rollout of new features | Tracks feature development lifecycle from coding to testing to deployment, connects to issues | Predefined columns ("Planned," "In Development," "Testing," "Released") | Auto-moves issues when linked pull requests are merged | Supports Agile – useful for incremental feature releases | Developers, product managers, QA teams | Lacks broader product roadmap context, may not cover dependencies across teams |

## Selection
The Iterative Development Template is the best approach for the Restaurant POS Ordering Menu System because it allows for incremental delivery of critical functionalities, flexibility in adapting to changing requirements, and continuous improvements based on real-world usage and feedback.

## Why Iterative Development
Below are key reasons why it is the most suitable option:

### **1. Prioritizes Essential Features for Early Delivery**
- The **Must-have** features (ordering, kitchen display, payments) are developed first to support restaurant operations.
- The **Should-have** and **Could-have** features are implemented in later sprints for refinement.

### **2. Allows for Continuous Feedback**
- Early releases allow users (customers, staff, managers) to provide feedback.
- Adjustments can be made before adding complex features.

### **3. Reduces Risk and Improves System Stability**
- **Core functionalities** are tested first before integrating advanced features.
- Payment processing and IT admin tools are included early to ensure system reliability.

### **4. Efficient Workflows & Parallel Development**
- Since different features are developed in iterations, development teams can work in parallel on different modules without dependencies blocking progress.
  Example: While one team works on digital payments, another can focus on kitchen display enhancements.

### **5. Enables Flexible Adaptation**
- If business needs change, future sprints can be adjusted.
- Additional features can be prioritized based on customer and staff feedback.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Complete Sprint 1** and collect user feedback.
2. **Refine backlog** based on real-world testing.
3. **Plan next development cycle** focusing on Should-have and Could-have features.
