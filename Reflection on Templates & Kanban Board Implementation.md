## Project Templates and Kanban Board Implementation

For this assignment, I didn't struggle much because I understood my project and what I intended to achieve. With the knowledge I have about Github so far, making the Project template analysis was not as difficult, even though putting it into words was a bit tricky.
I know how my project is going and the approach I took, so making a project selection was easy because it is basically what I have applied throughout the project so far. As per usual, I used the suggested tools to get guidance on how to approach this assignment.
At this stage, I have developed a personal connection with this project, as a result, completing these tasks has become a habit, regardless of the challenges I encounter. 
I am learning so much regarding software engineering, particularly this part of the project, which focuses on requirements, analysis, use cases, user stories, and the other interesting stuff we did in the previous assignments.
